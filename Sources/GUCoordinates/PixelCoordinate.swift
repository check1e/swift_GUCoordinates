/// A `PixelCoordinate` represents the coordinate of a pixel within an image
/// in centered pixel coordinates. This coordinate system is defined using
/// 4 fields: (x, y, resWidth, resHeight). The x and y fields must conform to
/// the following constraint:
///     `-floor((resWidth - 1) / 2) <= x <= ceil((resWidth - 1) / 2)`,
///     `-floor((resHeight - 1) / 2) <= y <= ceil((resHeight - 1) / 2)`.
/// This places the (0, 0) point in the center of the image. The coordinate
/// system can be depicted graphically as follows:
/// ```
///                            ceil((resHeight - 1) / 2)
///                                       ---
