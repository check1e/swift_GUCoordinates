 *  `RelativeCoordiante` is a polar coordinate in the form of phi, r where phi
 *  is the direction and r is the distance to the coordinate.

 *  The direction is an angle in degrees. A positive value for direction
 *  indicates that the target is on the left. A negative value indicates that
 *  the target is on the right. A value of zero indicates that the target is
